## Introduction
Drought is amongst many stressing factors that bring impairment to vegetation to various degrees.
It can be a severe threat to agricultural plants, especially when its recognition comes in too late in time.
So an early detection of water stress is of great interest to agriculture practice to prevent irreversible damages.
Normalised Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) is a satellite derived index,
which is useful for the purpose of early warning against dehydration of plants.

## Objective

- A drought relevant case study to illustrate the use of jupyer-notebook environment 

## Contents

- Background information about NDMI
